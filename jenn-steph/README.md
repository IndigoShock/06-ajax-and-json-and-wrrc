# Lab 06: jQuery AJAX & JSON

**Author**: Stephen Harper and Jennifer Bach
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
We're using ajax and jQuery to get and set JSON data from a remote source.

## Getting Started
Have VS Code. A browser (preferrably Chrome). jQuery. CSS. html.

## Architecture
The design is primarily Javascript. The html is the scaffoling while the CSS is used for page design. Languages: Javascript, html, CSS. Libraries: jQuery. Relevant design info: using ajax to retrieve info outside of local machine.

## Change Log
04-17-2018 12:34pm - Application now loads articles from a remote source. (Or in this case, localStorage).
